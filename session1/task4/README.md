# Task 4: Optimization Options

`pgm_tools.c` contains the PGM image manipulation program seen in earlier
weeks of the module.

1. Compile the program without any command line options.

2. Compile the program with minimal optimization, timing how long this takes:

       time gcc -O0 pgm_tools.c

   Make a note of the results.

3. Check the size in bytes of the executable. You can do this with

       wc -c a.out

4. Repeat Steps 1 & 2 above, using `-O3` instead of `-O0`. You should find
   that compilation takes a bit longer and the resulting executable is
   slightly larger.

5. Repeat Steps 1 & 2, using `-Os` instead of `-O0`, to optimize for space.
   You should see that the resulting executable is significantly smaller
   than before.
